I love hosting people from around the world that come to check out the most active volcano on the planet or the Playground of the Pacific, aka, Honolulu. I work full time as a carpenter and realtor. I actively study German and Japanese and love languages. I have enjoyed playing the piano and singing since I was very young. I was a massage therapist for 10 years, and a farmer. I have a strong interest in architecture and agriculture, utility systems, business and engineering. Looking forward to traveling and myself getting massages for a change! I hunger for knowledge, experience and truth.

I'm an artist with an MFA from the University of Hawai`i, but I became a real estate broker in order to support my disabled husband of 60 years, who passed away in July 2022.

I manage thirteen one bedroom condos in the Waikiki Skytower (three short blocks from the beach), one two bedroom, two bath condo in the Fairway Villa,just three blocks from Waikiki beach and one block to the International Marketplace, and one legal vacation rental studio at the Waikiki Grand Hotel, just a half block from the beach. I own a small real estate company, DW Realty LLC (RB-22573), located at 1123 11th Avenue #403, Honolulu, HI 96816, so if you want to buy something here on Oahu, I can help with that too.  My son is also a real estate broker and property manager, and we have helped a lot of people find their special place.  

My son and I both love helping people find a great place to stay on their vacation.

This was the first home Sherrie built in Hawaii after arriving from California in the 1970's.  I recently retired from a flying career with Hawaiian Airlines.  Sherrie was a Flight Attendant with Northwest Airlines among many other things.  We met when we got the last two available seats out of San Francisco to Honolulu on a fall day in 2001 shortly ofter 9/11.  We discovered that we both love the Ocean and and Hawaiian Lifestyle.  We were married a few months later and have been in Hawaii ever since.

We have no children, but on Oahu, we have a parrot, several cats, many fish ponds, and an old pig hunting dog that Sherrie kidnapped from the pig hunters.  Later we were told by the pig hunter that we could keep her.  She apparently wasn't a very good pig hunter.  They all comprise our family and actually keep us very busy every day.  

We have fruit trees and an extensive garden with banana and papayas on Oahu where we spend most of our time.  We sell our seasonal fruit to the sellers at the farmers markets on Oahu.  The Eluna House has a nice avocado tree, a coconut palm, a productive guava tree, and a Hayden mango tree that supplies the whole neighborhood with mangos it seems some summers.  We love our trees.

The Eluna house always has nice cool mornings.  And it is often comfortably cooler than the coast on those sunny Kona afternoons.  There are probably a hundred Jackson Chameleons in our shrubbery and trees.  If you want to see them, early in the morning when the sun starts warming things up they will start moving towards the light.  You can't really see them until they move.  When they start moving though, they are easy to spot.

We get to travel free on Hawaiian as part of our retirement benefits which has allowed us easy and frequent access to Kona for work and play.

Aloha~ Welcome! 
I am the proud new owner of HBR 4104/5/6! as of the end of April 2019! Having recently retired from my career, I love to stay busy, and boy am I with BBs Biz E HBR! Some may recognize me from TV & films I have done, others may know me as the originator of BB's Kids Acting School, or may know my watercolors and art work. But I simply grew up on the racetracks of Southern California, the daughter of a quite famous jockey, & spent the first 3rd of my life either on horseback or in the ocean. The love of both brought me to Kauai originally in 1979 which has now truly become my Spiritual home away from home. This is a dream come true, being able to share this magical Island with you. Come & see why it becomes nearly impossible to leave... Hope to see you soon!

Semi-retired, Roxanne works per diem as a nurse and Nicholas is a writer. We have no children and no pets, so we can travel happily and have been vacationing in Hawaii for at least 20 years. We love the new booking freedom which is given by the companies like Air B and B, which give you back the feel of making your own bookings and making travel affordable!

We love mountains, the ocean, music, media, and great coffee. We adore getting away into nature, and appreciating beauty. We also really value cleanliness, order, and good design.

We have traveled to Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany, Mexico, and much of the United States. My husband was in the Peace Corps in Micronesia, and then was drafted out of the Peace Corps into the military in the late 60's. Then, he went back to school to achieve his master in architecture from Stanford University. Roxanne went to the University of Washington in the school of Nursing, and has been a nurse ever since: she has enjoyed Intensive care for 10 years, the Regional Trauma Center at Harborview for 18 years, and Interventional Radiology Nursing for 15 years after that. She still works in I.R. per diem.  Travel really refreshes us both, and we have come from our travels with deeper respect for the beauty of life each time.

What are the five things I can't live without.  

1.   My car.  I've never been without a car, except short periods of time.  I really don't like to depend on others to get me around. 
2.  Clean running water.  I  had never been where I couldn't have water, but know I wouldn't like it.
3.  Love.  I've been in a situation where I lost my love.  It is very lonely and uncomfortable, to say the least. 

My favorite place I've ever been is Athens, Greece.  I was fortunate enough to be able to visit two different times while stationed in Turkey.   It’s a beautiful place to visit.  I've often thought I would move there.  But it’s too far from where I need to be.

I was once a homeless couch surfer and he came from a privileged family, yet humble and kind as can be. We met in the most unlikely place in the middle of Hawaii and have been with each other ever since. We own the real estate, however, I am the management team of the properties. This has become my full-time career along with the crazy restaurant in Hawaii. I put in 120% energy when embarking on a purchase of real property and converting into the ultimate vacation or long term rental experience. Yes, I do both. I grew up in the world of hospitality on the Islands of Maui and Oahu. I have eaten, resided and worked with all demographics. I love to travel and have stayed in my fair share of short term rentals that were never meant to be advertised as such. I used this as education and the inspiration to start one of my most successful ventures in my life. I know what I am truly passionate about. The pandemic was a two fold lesson and I am learning to embrace the change everyday. I hope you enjoy the mountain house or the hale in Hawaii as much as we do. It is the fruit of my hard work to read the honest review of another human who, recognizes how much effort was put forth.
I would love to invite anyone, who reads to the end of this story, a complimentary item or discount to their Experience Activity in Hawaii, a new form of business we decided to partner with Airbnb with.  The Surf and Bento package Experience is live. Please stay tuned on canoe rides, VIP tours and lei creation classes. We are bringing back the vintage world.

I have been doing lodging rentals since 2018 and tours since 2019. I genuinely love the “work” that I am privileged to do as well as the people I get to meet along the way! My training and experience has provided me with the skills and knowledge necessary to not just provide a safe experience, but also a fun one where you will enjoy the natural environment and learn about the culture and how to respect the land and kanaka while you are a visitor of the islands. 

Unlike many that move here and still surround themselves in their same culture, I have surrounded myself in Hawaiian culture and learned first hand of the Hawaiian deities (Kane, Kanaloa, Pele, Ku, Lono, Aila’au, etc), beliefs and customs directly from the people of the land. I have drive-in access to places like Namahoe, known popularly and incorrectly as the Mermaid Ponds as well as various other places on the island. Because of my respect for the land and culture, these things have been shared with me. I can tell you Hawaiian names for constellations, the stories behind them and what their placement in the sky means at certain times of the year. I can share information about Hawaiian sorcery, customs, beliefs, sayings. Things that other guides on here, unless they are from the islands, do not know. I provide a bridge to learn correct information about the land including the proper place names. Many people move here and search online for information which only leads to spreading misinformation. If you want a guide that can teach you accurate information, that wasn’t read online by a misleading article, but instead shared on the ha (breath) by people from the islands, which is the traditional way, look no further!

This isn’t just a job or way to make money for me. There are a plethora of ways to make money. I didn’t move here, decide I love it and search online for misinformation to capitalize off of the land that I say I love. What I have is a passion and reverence for the land. Which is evident in the time I have taken to acquire the knowledge that I have.
