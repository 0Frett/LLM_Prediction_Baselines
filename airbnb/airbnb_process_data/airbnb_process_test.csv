Other attractions include Maui Ocean Center, Haleakala Volcano, Shops at Wailea, Iao Valley, Wailea Golf Club, King Kamehameha Golf Club, Maui Tropical Plantation, and the Whale Sanctuary. The town of Kihei is a quant, laid-back beach town boasting some of Maui’s most pristine stretches of white sand and turquoise waters. South Maui is fun for couples and families alike. Y","Aloha!

I have been a property manager and owner for 19 years. 30 years ago, I made Lantana my home, and I am proud to say it is still the great coastal town that I grew up loving. Whether you enjoy going to the beach, boating, shopping, or sampling the local fare, Lantana is the place to go - and stay a little while. 

I have also spent a lot of time on the Big Island of Hawaii, and like most, remain fascinated by all that it has to offer.  This was why I took on the adventure of converting shipping containers into off-grid vacation bungalows on the lava fields of Kalapana. It was an adventure I will never forget. These lush interiors are situated directly on the lava field and under a night sky lit by thousands of twinkling stars.  With the ocean as your view and Kilauea volcano in your backyard, it is truly a once in a lifetime experience you won’t soon forget.

Hilo could become known as 'the town that time forgot' because it has the flavor of an older, slower Hawaii. In that way we are pretty easy going and relaxed ourselves. We have two guest cottages and a romantic 1 bedroom apartment here at The Lotus Garden. This is a property that features two garden courtyards, stone Buddha statues, a fish pond and an abundance of tropical plants and trees. . The Lotus Garden is reminiscent of the former 'sugar cane plantation days' when houses were clustered together so that there was a sense of community in the way people lived. Here Travelers meet other travelers in passing. Another wonderful feature of The Lotus Garden is that we are right in the center of town.

Mom, “AlohaDebbie” still loves to swim, snorkel and paddle her ocean kayak. Debbie acquired her real estate brokers license in 1985 and found a niche in vacation rental management 10 years later. Taking care of vacation homes and world travelers has been Debbie’s life and love for the past 30 years. Tally and Leilani grew up in the business, always helping with guest requests, whether that was delivering a kayak or a coffee pot.

Together, Leilani and Debbie have managed vacation rentals since 1995.  Tally joined in 2017. Leilani Properties & Aloha Kai Properties have a handful of high quality vacation homes, or as we say in Hawaiian “Na Hale Pono” – just the best! Our goal has always been to carry the spirit of aloha into our beautiful vacation homes and to the people who visit them. Our properties are well maintained and full of charm, beauty and comfort.

We hope you will come back again and again and make us your home away from home.

Aloha Kai is abbreviated for “ke aloha ka i ʻoi aʻe” -love is the greatest of all and it comes from a song called ʻEkolu Mea Nuii

ʻO manaʻoʻiʻo, ka manaʻolana
A me ke aloha ke aloha ka i ʻoi aʻe
Pōmaikaʻi nā mea a pau
Pōmaikaʻi nā mea a pau

Living on the dynamic Big Island for a while I am well aware of the potential natural hazards of the Volcano, earthquakes, Tsunamis and Storms, at any moment, and have chosen my properties to avoid those risks and exist with a peace of mind in knowing that. Ocean view place in Wainaku is the closest can be to the ocean and not be in the Tsunami evacuation zone, so no need worry about where to go if and when those sirens go off in the middle of the night because of some big quake in Chile, Alaska, Japan, or local. With the realities of Climate change more people are recognizing that being too close to level water, no matter where in the world, is becoming more risky. The place in Fern Acres, Mountain View, is well secluded from hazards and when Kilauea was erupting from May - September 2018, it had minimal effects as Volcano area shook constantly and Lower Puna inundated by lava. Although the Volcano has settled and quieted for now, living on the Big Island teaches that people, places, and things are all very transient so never take things for granted, appreciate what you have and are blessed with now, for life is precious and can change in an instant.",100.0,99.0,1,1.0,6,1 bath,2.0,2.0,1,7,29,55,280,325,96,3,4.87,1,7.14,183.0,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

Since then I've explored homesteading and a closer connection to our land. I have been building and creating. Now I am ready to share the house with travelers who visit this magical place. I am into a peaceful sustainable existence, that gives rest to a fast moving civilization. Sometimes it is enough to just look at the stars, and here you can see them well, or just return to the original TV, a nice relaxing fire. And I love to cook on the flames, so simple, so good. Sharing food is my favorite form of communion. I love slow cooking, whether it be smoking or stew making. Slower and longer is just better if you ask me. 

I am a builder, and as a builder the most gratifying thing is to see people enjoying the manifestations that have been created. Sometimes the focus of what it means to construct something for the utilitarian purpose gets lost in the process. But, the magic is always underlying everything, so many times pure serendipity is right there, reminding us. The intention is everything and construed in all the stones carried, wood carved, land sculpted and much, much else. When the energy is pure, then it is easily conveyed or felt.

My husband Pat and I are retired and spend 4 to 6 months of the year on the Big Island and 6 months in Montana.  We definitely have the best of both worlds.  We remodeled our studio when we first bought it and invested a lot of blood, sweat and even a few tears to get it to what we feel is a homey, luxurious, tropical hideaway.  Because we spent so much effort in remodeling, we have only recently decided to rent it out through Airbnb.   This has become our second home so we loaded it with upper end furniture and amenities.  We love that all our favorite restaurants and happy hours are within walking distance, and the pier and a lovely snorkel beach are close by as well. The Big Island is not for everyone, but if you love raw beauty and are adventurous, then you are coming to the right place.

My name is Quinten and I was born and raised here Oahu. I graduated from Loyola Marymount University in 2015 in LA with a degree in Entrepreneurship and International Business. I worked as an English Language teacher for a bit here in Oahu while helping my mom renovate the guest house we are now offering on Airbnb.

I personally shy away from the beaches here ironically, but I do know the right spots to go; its inevitable to go to the beach growing up and living here. I also have many good recommendations for hikes, places to eat, and other sightseeing spots.

The best part about running a vacation rental thus far has been introducing our guests to our cats, dog, and turtle.

I am also still hoping to challenge a guest in a ping pong match as we have a table in our main house.

Congratulations on your decision to book a vacation in sunny Maui, Hawaii; the #1 island in the world for over 25 years.  :)

I would be honored to help you choose accommodations in Maui that fit your needs, desires, and budget. 

As a full-time resident on Maui for over 15 years, I am very familiar with all that this wonderful Island has to offer.  I absolutely love my job as both an owner and property manager of vacation rentals on Maui.  The fact that I get to help others plan their Hawaiian vacation and/or relocation to the magical island of Maui is literally the icing on top of the cupcake!

If you are wanting to purchase property on Maui, I am a licensed realtor in the State of Hawai'i, own a property management company in Maui, and am also a certified Home Staging Expert.  I would love to speak with you and answer any questions you might have about vacation rentals on Maui.

In addition to managing lots of amazing properties directly across the street from the awesome, sun kissed beaches of south Maui, I am also the proud owner of my own vacation rentals.   The condos I own are called Tracy’s Tropical Treasures.  They are listed on Airbnb as Tracy's Tropical Treasure #1 (Ocean View), Tracy's Tropical Treasure #2 (Corner Penthouse), Tracy's Tropical Treasure #3 (Ocean View), and my newest addition, Paradise Awaits You! Tracy's Tropical Treasure #4 (Ocean View, Central A.C., and double pane windows, so no road noise inside the condo).  *Tracy’s Tropical Treasure #3 and Paradise Awaits You! Tracy's Tropical Treasure #4 both house up to 4 guests.  :)

Tracy’s Tropical Treasures were Named the #1 Vacation Rentals in all of Maui in 2016.

In November, 2019, I was RANKED #1 again.  ;)

In July of 2022, I was ranked #1 in Kihei for the fourth time.

I have worked very hard for these achievements and on every single occasion, it was one of the best days of my life when I received confirmation that I had won the award.  

I look forward to speaking with you, helping you with your Maui vacation/relocation, and sharing my ALOHA spirit.  I have been in the hospitality industry for over 25 years, and it's really how I choose to live my life.  Pampering guests is my #1 priority!  

* With well over 1000 bookings on the 4 rentals I personally own, I am extremely proud and take great pride in the fact that I have so many wonderful reviews.  Please feel free to check out all the reviews on Airbnb for the proof.   Customer Service is very important to me!

I am also very proud that I have been with Airbnb since 2009 and have also been a ""SUPERHOST” since the program was created.  In July of 2022, I earned Superhost status for the 33rd consecutive time.  

Airbnb is, without a doubt, the BEST vacation rental platform of all!  

When Airbnb was first created, I was one of only eight listings in all of Maui.  My claim to fame is that Brian Chesky, himself, actually called me.  Brian is one of the three Airbnb founders.  Back then, I had also listed my car on Airbnb, and Brian said I was the first person to ever list a car on his platform.  He thought it was interesting, and we had a very nice telephone conversation.

By the end of 2020, Maui had over 18,000 vacation rental listings.  The Airbnb platform has grown exponentially.  I am truly honored to be a part of it all; both as an owner and as a property manager and will continue to tell everyone how wonderful Airbnb is for hosts and travelers alike.

Everybody, no matter where they are, can live ALOHA.  Maui is a great way to unlock the positive spirit within all of us.....

Make it a great day!

I under estimated how nice and how much fun it is to live here, and now I have a house here and no desire to leave. The laid back country atmosphere we have here on the North Shore is alluring- so much nicer than the crazy Waikiki tourist sausage machine.

I'm active and try to complete the whole range of sports possible here on the north shore. In fact my favorite days are when you get a ""trifecta"" - any three of the surfing, kiting, free diving SUPPing, mountain biking, motocross, beaching, hiking etc actives possible here.

One concept i live by is ""Life is for the living""  I enjoy sharing these good times with other adventurous people.

Sharp, “AlohaDebbie” started her family on the Big Island over 40 years ago. We are a happy, loving family (Ohana) of five children in Love (aloha) with the Ocean (kai). Leilani was born in Kealakekua and her younger brother, Joseph Talman, who goes by “Tally” was born in Hilo. Both have a passion for the water. Leilani is an avid paddler and Tally loves to surf. Mom, “AlohaDebbie” still loves to swim, snorkel and paddle her ocean kayak. Debbie acquired her real estate brokers license in 1985 and found a niche in vacation rental management 10 years later. Taking care of vacation homes and world travelers has been Debbie’s life and love for the past 30 years. Tally and Leilani grew up in the business, always helping with guest requests, whether that was delivering a kayak or a coffee pot.

Together, Leilani and Debbie have managed vacation rentals since 1995.  Tally joined in 2017. Leilani Properties & Aloha Kai Properties have a handful of high quality vacation homes, or as we say in Hawaiian “Na Hale Pono” – just the best! Our goal has always been to carry the spirit of aloha into our beautiful vacation homes and to the people who visit them. Our properties are well maintained and full of charm, beauty and comfort.

We hope you will come back again and again and make us your home away from home.

A Deeper Meaning of Aloha Kai….

Aloha Kai is abbreviated for “ke aloha ka i ʻoi aʻe” -love is the greatest of all and it comes from a song called ʻEkolu Mea Nuii

ʻO manaʻoʻiʻo, ka manaʻolana
A me ke aloha ke aloha ka i ʻoi aʻe
Pōmaikaʻi nā mea a pau
Pōmaikaʻi nā mea a pau

Faith, hope and love,
love is the best
And everything is blessed
And everything is blessed

We bought our first vacation rental property in 2001 at Sandpiper Village in Princeville and spent about 5-1/2 months renovating it.  We dreamed that one day we might be able to make Kauai our permanent home, and we were fortunate to actually make this happen in January of 2006.  We bought our second vacation rental property at Puamana in August of last year (2010), as our second vacation rental property. and after a renovation period, placed it on line as a 3 bedroom 2 bath townhouse vacation rental.
My wife still works as a flight attendant and I am retired (for all the guys out there, I'll be writing a book soon about how to make that happen).  However, I keep busy managing both properties, when we're not dancing, playing softball/tennis, or at the beach.  One of the advantages of living here on Kauai and offering vacation properties for rent is that any issues with units that may arise are addressed immediately and decisively through direct communication between the guests and me, the owner. There is no go-between management company in the loop to delay any action that may be required.  It's a win-win for everyone.
Mahalo for visiting AirBNB and if you have any questions, call me at home 808-245-4830 or cell 808-651-0503.

Of all the places that I have been, Maui is the only place that I feel right at home. Fell in love with Maui since my first visit in the early part of 1990s. Since then, I have returned for a vacation getaway every year and in 2020 moved to Maui permanently! The island is breathtaking, the beaches are spectacular and the people are welcoming.

I came across Kihei Sands Beachfront Condominiums walking along Sugar Beach on one rainy night in December not too long ago. When I stepped onto this property, I instantly felt safe and relaxed. It was serene and calm.  I saw a sky luminous with infinite number of stars, felt the warm rain on my skin, heard the ocean waves crashing against the shore and observed the guests socializing as they were having fun by the BBQs. When some of the guests saw me sitting on the lounge chair, they came over and offered to share their dinner with me. I was taken back by their kindness and the atmosphere of Kihei Sands. I knew right then that I had to be an owner here. 

I finally bought unit A5, a 1 Bedroom/1 Bath Condo in January of 2017. 

A5 has many repeat guests. I love sharing the Spirit of Aloha with others. My goal is to provide you a Great VACATION Experience with MEMORIES that will last a LIFETIME. Kihei Sands is truly a HIDDEN GEM.

I am the owner and manager of these lovely vacation rentals in Kailua-Kona.   I lived in Silicon Valley California for over 25 years and worked as a software engineer and the founder of a few successful start-up companies.  I built several successful start-up companies and pursued our entrepreneur dreams there.   I loved living in the California Bay Area and still consider it our ""Home on the Mainland"".

Emmy's lifelong dream has always been to live by the ocean in tropical islands. When I first truly memorable experience in Hawaii was the family vacation on the cruise ship that visited each of the Hawaiian islands.  We fall in love with Kona, Big Island the best.  There is so much to do here, with crystal clear water for snorkeling, rainforests, waterfalls, and volcanoes to explore, and mountains that almost reach the stars.

I bought my first dream house in 2013, and 3 years later, just after our daughter graduated from high school in California in 2016. Then we moved to Kona.  Besides high tech, one of Emmy’s lifelong interests has been real estate. Every destination Emmy visited, she loved exploring the properties in the area.   Combining our love for Hawaii and homes, now we own and manage 8 beautiful vacation rental houses.

We have put much effort into every house to make them as comfortable and welcoming as your home.  We use the latest technologies on the rental houses, with smart locks, amazon Alexa, comprehension customized online welcome book for each guest and much more. 

We are responsible and responsive to your inquiries.   We live close to all of our rental houses, we are always available for our guests.   We do our best to provide the best services to our guests.

I am originally from Alaska.  I am the 3rd child of 3. Older brother and older sister!  I grew up as a small town country boy doing the usual hunting and fishing with my father. He was a bush pilot and so I was able to experience most of the Alaskan Wilderness! 

We raised pigs and chickens, turkeys and ducks, also had a horse and a bunch of dogs and cats!  I played Hockey my entire childhood and loved every minute of it!  I’m kinda a golfer now though!!

After high school, I joined the United States Navy and was stationed in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. After my time in the Navy I stayed in Hawaii and became a self made entrepreneur. I opened my first retail store in Waikiki at the age of 21.  I have opened 2 more locations since then and have been in the customer service industry for 20+years!

I just recently purchased a condo and would like to share my outstanding customer service skills to any and all potential travelers coming to our beautiful state of Hawaii.

We are a constant work in progress, so please be kind. If you are looking for luxury then you should probably book your reservations with a 5* Hotel. 
Our homes are comfortable, humble yet amazing! We are blessed with both the Sun Rise and Moon Rise in our backyard! It doesn't get more magical than that!
Our properties are Ocean front vs beach front which lends to the privacy our guests enjoy. It also puts wear and tear on our exterior which is tended to on a regular basis, but paint and ocean breezes are not always friends :) 
Focus on the amazing scenery and views and you will be content. Our “shabby chic” houses are blessings and realize that you are only visiting for a few days, not buying the house, so if you see a blemish, RELAX! We are a constant work in progress. Experience waking up to the most beautiful sunrises that Hauula has to offer. 
You may experience raw ocean activity of waves splashing up on the deck and lawn at times during high tides. Tides come in and they go out, so relax, release and enjoy. 
If you enjoy nature and kick back type of folks, we welcome you! If you want pristine, flawless properties, please do not choose to stay with us, we are not your cup of tea and that can only be a bummer for you and us. 
We do our best to offer a comfortable and clean environment for your stay. If something is not to your expectations, we request you to contact us and we will do everything in our power to correct it. We want you to enjoy your time here! PLEASE refrain from leaving mean-spirited reviews after the fact. Give us the opportunity to make things right. 
You may request a scheduled visit to the animal sanctuary and hikes to the top of our mountain with panoramic views of the windward coast, nature excursions, animal therapy, farming experience, and so much more. A donation or tip for the guide is appreciated for their time and expertise. 
You are welcome to partake in any of our various activities just inquire.
We ask that our guests respect the surroundings and leave the premise free of trash, cigarette butts, etc.
People have asked us if they can fish off our backyard............Well, the answer is please NO! There are several beaches along the coastline that are open for fishing and spearing. We prefer the animals in an out of the water feel safe in our private little haven. We are also surrounded by rock reefs and don't want broken fishing lines off our property. It causes harm to turtles, seals, fish. Thank you for respecting that :)
Our units have Pur Water Filters installed in the kitchens for drinking. We ask that you choose to bring a container to refill vs cases of plastic bottles to add to the land fill. Our goals are to be as environmentally friendly as possible. Most of our homes are solar equipped so if you can leave lights and air off during the day when not there it helps us to save resources. 
If you leave things on and are gone for the day, our staff is instructed to turn things off.

A little about myself; 
I moved to the Big Island in 1993 from Guam after serving a short stint in the USCG during the Golf War,  then worked as an acute care nurse at our local Hilo hospital for the last 22 years.  

Ive remained mesmerized by this island’s amazing natural beauty, diverse ecosystems, terrains, and love the laid back lifestyle it provides which easily translated into me transforming my house to one I can happily and proudly share with those seeking to explore and experience this amazing island in a relaxed home setting.  

I'm originally  from the Micronesian Island of Yap,  known for its pristine water, manta ray dives ( check out the world-famous  Yap Divers ) and  its colorful and spirited bamboo war dance performed by bare chested natives in lion clothes and grass skirts, something I grew up doing.   
I embrace  cultural diversity and truly enjoy meeting people from all walks of life and all regions in the world.  I take pride in my house and the service that I provide my guests. I value my precious 'free' time by sneaking in sporadic reading here and there  and enjoying the outdoors; camping, hiking, swimming, kayaking, paddle board, and gardening, but most of all, I love traveling and looking forward to seeing a lot more of this amazing world we live in and experience different cultures along the way.

I’m always striving for a balanced lifestyle; healthy living through heath conscious cooking utilizing locally grown, ( a lot are my own home grown) produce, keeping physically active, and inner peace and serenity.

A little bit about myself: I have a degree in Architecture, and own a construction company. I love building and seeing the smile on people's faces when they see the home of their dreams, it puts a smile in my heart. 

The same happiness I get from building, I get from hosting; I love to meet people from all walks of life learn about their cultures, and see the smile on their face when they arrive in my home.

In my free time I enjoy spending it with my family and friends, having a nice glass of good wine with my loved ones, and taking my dogs out for a swim at the beach on a beautiful sunny day.

Enjoy life to the max when you can.
