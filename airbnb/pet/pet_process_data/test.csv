Recently there was a new dog at home and Ken was kicked out of the house. Poor loyal Ken remained infront of the gate waiting for his ex-owner to want him again but that day never come. Ken stayed there under sun or rain, his soaked body shivering in the cold night.. A kind feeder has been giving food to Ken now and then. On other days he would starve. Found an adopter for Ken but after just one day, the adopter decides once again to give him up becoz her parents didn't like her bringing home a dog. If we cant find an adopter, Ken may be once again forced to live on the streets, in front of his ex-ex owner's gate. :( Now the neighbors started complaining about Ken and attempt to report to the local council.

The mother cat moved to our garden after she got the babies and we took her in to join the rest of our cats and kittens. I love cats but we already had one cat and just adopted a mom with 4 kittens, to take care of 6 is more than enough... The mom and her kittens deserve a new loving home where they can be given more care and attention. Bonnie, the mother is a nice long hair, very clean, calm loves to cuddle and never made any mess. She just got sterilized to prevent another pregnancy. About the kittens, we asked the vet, but it´s impossible to guess the gender yet, so we named them unisex (of course you can choose other names): Oreo is a very active and playful white and black cat, Marbles has pale red and black marks on its white fur while Patches white fur comes with many red and black spots, Marbles and Patches stick together all the time, so it would be great if someone could take both. But it’s not a must. Tiny, the smallest, is a white and red tabby, very quiet and a bit shy. Twilight, is not related with the other ones, I guess someone placed it in our garden. We were not able to locate the mother. It has medium long dark grey hair with a black tabby pattern, blue eyes, is playful, energetic and curious. It would be great if some of them could stay together. But as long as you are willing to provide much love, good care and a safe environment, we will separate them. If you have any problems in keeping them, you can return them to us immediately, no questions asked. If it is important to you, the cats stay in a ""halal"" household.

Saya mula memberi dia makan semenjak 2-3 bulan yang lepas. Dia muncul di rumah saya secara tiba2 & dari entah mana. Saya pun terus memberikan dia makanan & minuman setiap hari. Umur Fifi ni saya tak pasti, tapi saya rasa dia belom mencapai umur setahun lagi. Seminggu dua lepas, saya perasan yang dia ada kurap sedikit di bahagian telinga jadi saya terus bawa dia ke vet. Alang-alang tu, saya ambil keputusan untuk spay/mandulkan Fifi sekali. Sekarang luka pembedahan pemandulan/spaying Fifi serta kurapnya sudah hampir pulih. Dulu masa mula2, Fifi agak garang & amat takut dengan manusia, walaupun dengan saya yang setiap hari bagi dia makan. Tapi, lepas bawak dia balik dari spaying ni, baru saya tahu yang rupa-rupanya Fifi ni adalah seekor kucing yang teramat manja & perlukan kasih sayang & belaian. Dia langsung dah tak garang lagi malah akan kerap datang dekat dengan saya untuk menggosok2 badannya. Pendek kata, sekarang Fifi amat friendly & sangatlah manja. Saya rasa sayang & kesian sekiranya kucing yang manja sebegini terus hidup sebagai seekor kucing stray, jadi saya nak put her up for adoptian. Moga2 Fifi akan dapat forever home & tuan yang akan menyayanginya dengan sepenuh hati. Tiada apa-apa caj yang dikenakan. Fifi pun telah di spay. Adopter hanya perlu memastikan Fifi akan divaksinkan & dinyahkutu & dinyahcacing dalam masa terdekat. That's all. Fifi ni seekor stray cat yang bersifat teramat-amat manja. It would be a pity if she remains a stray after her spaying surgery. Hence I'm looking for an adopter for her. Dia suka dengan belaian & sentuhan orang & akan mengiau-ngiau sehingga dapat belaian dari orang. Dia juga bersifat attention-seeking dan suka berada di mana sahaja orang berada. She needs a lot of loving. Please adopt her someone.

Due to her active and plucky nature she is more suited for outdoor living, but if you're experienced with housebreaking puppies keeping her indoors shouldn't be a problem. /09: For those curious about estimated size and age, the vet estimates Nera is between 2-3 months old.

And he has finally brought his tail out from between his legs and is even wagging his tail! When we picked Simba up, he was really so scared and frightened that his tail was stuck between his legs!Poor thing... I don't normally say mean things, but I hope that his owners rot in hell for abandoning him, for letting him suffer physical and mental stress of living on the streets and fending for himself, for being knocked down by a car and injuring his leg and for being caught by the dog catchers! ******************* /14 This is Simba. He was abandoned by his owners when they shifted out of their house. They just threw him out on the streets. The poor boy waited for them to come back for him and refused to move from that road eventhough it was a very busy road. The neighbours in the area started feeding him and they tried to catch him several times. But he would always evade them. Sometime last week, he was hit by a car and his front leg was injured. Again the people that were feeding him tried to catch him but to no avail. And then one idiotic and heartless neighbour decided to report him to the council (saying that he was a dangerous dog although he kept to himself and was just waiting for his family) and poor Simba got caught. The people feeding him called me and asked me to help get him out. Thankfully I managed to claim him back from the council. But Simba was petrified when we went to get him out. He couldn't move. He was frozen with fear. There were lots of other dogs there that had been caught and I know that this is the case with all the council pounds. I wish I could have taken them all, but I couldn't... :( It took us quite a while to finally get him out but we finally succeeded. We brought him back to my place and it took over an hour before he finally realised that he was safe. He had a good sleep, probably the first time he slept peacefully since he was abandoned. He will be going to vet today and I would be grateful if one of you could help foster him while he recovers from his injury, and while I look for a new forever home for him. He will not do well being boarded as he is quite a timid dog... We could look after him ourselves but we already have way too many animals... Please call me if you can help foster this lovely boy. I will take care of all medical expenses and food bills etc. I just need a home environment where he can rest and regain his faith in humans. Or better still, if you can give him a forever home that he deserves, that will be even better. Please SMS or WhatsApp me at if you can either foster or adopt Simba. If you can't, please help share this so that Simba will have a better chance of getting a home. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ADOPTION: 1. Must not be caged or chained unnecessarily. 2. Must be given clean shelter from the heat and rain. 3. Must be fed proper food and be given access to water at all times. 4. Must be given medical care and attention when necessary. 5. Will only be released to the adopter after neutering. ********************** PS: If you ever lose your dog, please call all the nearby councils and insist that you want to go and check their pounds cause sometimes they will just say that they didn't catch any dogs in a particular area. Your dog could be waiting for you helplessly! And you should check immediately on the day you lost the dog and the subsequent days after that. Cause sometimes they may not be taken to the pound immediately.",115d6458f,1.178614874015425,3,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,23,-3.56513699608274,0.9881143878462914,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Please call ----------------------------------------------------- Adoption Procedure: This dog has been caught by Majlis Perbandaran Klang, and if nobody comes forward to adopt it, it will be euthanized within a few days. Even owned dogs are also often caught, and the owners are not aware for it. Those wishing to adopt this pet from Klang Dog Pound, please follow the procedures below: 1. Drive to Pusat Kurungan Haiwan Lebuh Sultan Muhammad Kawasan Perindustrian Bandar Sultan Sulaiman Pelabuhan Klang Tel : (For Sat & Sun, opening hours are 8am - 12pm) 2. Secure a Borang Permohonan Tuntutan Anjing, Selepas Tempoh 7 hari. Complete it & ensure it is endorsed by the relevant officier & stamped with relevant chop. 3. Provide a photostated copy of your Identification Card or Passport with each application * policies & requirements stiffen day by day * Advisable to provide a copy of IC/Passport per application (Just in case) * Secure extra application if there is any inkling of additional adoption. * Don't expect any leniency (Even we committee members, slaves & beggars don't have any unless OK by big guy) 4. Please be compassionate. Put yourself in their shoes: locked inside knowing its over. THEY DO KNOW. 5. I have seen them wasted much close to D days. Don't tell me they didn't undergo heightened enxiety & despair in anticipation of the end. What's worse their owners never came for them.

The nice lady posted flyers around the area and asked all the Puchong vets about me but after 3 weeks no one has claimed me.

I'm good with other dogs and like playing with small to medium dogs. I have sensitive skin so I hope my human will feed me a good quality diet. I do my potty on the grass or near drainhole covers - my carer thinks I was previously an indoor dog and perhaps potty trained to wee in the bathroom :) Since my past is unknown, I haven't been sent for neutering but please do the responsible thing and spay me after I go on heat if that happens. I'd really like to spend many happy days cuddling on the couch with someone who will tickle my ears and kiss my little apple head - are you the one for me?"" Conditions for adoption: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging up. 2. Maintain medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 3. Adoption fee of RM to partially cover vaccination, deworming, heartworm test/prevention, tick + flea prevention and skin treatment. 4. If she is found to be intact (i.e. goes on heat), spay after her heat cycle ends. 5. Allow visits in the initial stages of adoption to ensure dog is adjusting well - for this reason adopters residing in Klang Valley are strongly preferred. 6.

Like the siamese. But she is most probably mixed breed. Has blue eyes. She suddenly appeared where we live. So it only means one thing. She's either lost or like most pretty cats that end up here...abandoned. Mosu Mosu is special compared to other cats. Why is a cat like her out here on the streets ?!? She definitely must have been a house cat before. She is very affectionate, gentle and slightly cowardly dealing with other cats but very friendly. She gets attached to humans very quickly. She has never scratched or bit us. but once when I was unconsciously jiggling my house keys, she scratched me accidentally while trying to catch the keys.No wounds. so she plays too I guess. She trusts us waaaay too much. She got herself attached here and when she got pregnant she glued herself here. She behaves absolutely like a house cat ! Seems more intelligent than any other cats here. Maybe due to her mixed breed genes ? -Very well behaved and understands when we say ""no"". -When we let she uses the litter box. When we close it she goes outside to do her ""business"" I'm pretty healthy and had no signs of allergies so far despite having so many stray cats around. But lately I've gotten really sick. It seems I am allergic to Mosu Mosu. She's too furry. Only the mama cat(Mosu Mosu) makes me sneeze and have runny nose. But Mosu Mosu is attached to us and hates and refuses to socialise with other outside cats. So I am hiding the fact that she is making me sick from my family. So I need someone to at least help foster her or something because I don't want to send her to places like PAWS or SPCA. Anyone who likes a cuddle cat who is gentle and affectionate that does not cause trouble will love Mosu Mosu !",d46569700,0.6051891830345133,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,10,0.8416508128147867,0.9664879356568364,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Unlike the others, he has become extremely tame and affectionate. While this is nice for us caretakers, it has made our sweet boy vulnerable to abuse. We suspect he has been intentionally harmed at least twice. Once he suffered a terrible wound on his chest that looked like he had been scalded with boiling water. More recently he became very ill and we think he was poisoned. Our neighbors have been complaining about the stray cats because they are pampered losers with nothing better to do with their lives. In light of these things against our little Cranks, it is with heavy hearts that we have decided to put him up for adoption. We love him but we are both full with our own pet cats and foster animals at the moment. I cannot afford to give him the quality of life that he so deserves and the attention that he craves. I think Mr CrankyPants would get along best as an only cat, or with a spayed female cat. I say this because he does not get along with the other male cats in the feral colony but he is just fine with the females. What's special about Cranks? Sure, he looks like an ordinary grey tabby but his personality is one in a million. He is the sweetest, most affectionate, and attention-seeking cat I have ever met and believe me I've met a lot of cats! He loves giving cuddles as much as he loves receiving them. When he has bonded to someone, he can't get enough of their love and he is never finished affectionately butting his head on you and expressing his gratitude. This cuddlebunny used to be the king of the colony but now he's a teddy bear. He's already been neutered and is healthy and toilet-trained. All that's left now is to find him his perfect human match. Could that be you? Would you like a kitty as sweet, loving, and loyal as a dog? Then Cranks is the one for you. Email or text me if you're interested. More pictures coming soon! He's pretty hard to photograph because he can't sit still! He's constantly rubbing his head on me and being super duper manja. Please, no caging except in instances of illness of injury.

She provided everything she could so Angel can have a chance to live a normal life. Many would believe a dog born with such disabilities should be put to sleep. As the owner is working and fearing Angel may hurt herself, he is currently living in a cage 24 hours a day. The owner would like Angel to have a normal life running and playing around just like other dogs. We are now looking for a loving home for little Angel. It's our hope to find a owner who accept him with this disabilities and love him unconditionally so he can live life to the fullest. Our recommendation to potential adopters : a) Ask yourself the following questions : - Am I ready to be the owner of a blind dog. - Did I have the commitment needed? - Did I have the knowledge? - Did I have the right conditions in my home? - Most importantly, did I have the love in my heart to raise this dog? b) Allocate time so both yourself and Angel can understand each other. c) Provide time for training so Angel can recognise sounds. If you believe you can raise Angel and in return inspired others to care/raise blind puppies, please contact me for further details. “Blind Dogs See With Their Heart and Are Worth Loving”.",d596234fc,0.0317634920536015,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,44,-17.213867665485047,0.995710455764075,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

I guess she was stucked there for almost 2days or so coz after I freed her, she kinda stumble in her walk. Then I realized she's blind as there is no reaction in her eyes movement when my fingers go near her eyes and she walk without direction. I took her in hopefully to adopt her permanently but I am staying in condo. And about a week plus or so, I noticed that she can actually see because she was following my cats around. I thought its because she can hear them or smell them, but no its not. SUNNY IS NOT BLIND! That was a good news. And now she is super naughty and enjoys playing w the cats and eats w them. But she still need a proper place especially a landed property or garden she can run around. And she will bark and make noise one day and condo is not a place for her.

He was trained to play rough by a muscular Judo Master. He acts like dog. Whenever he's tired or nervous, he'll start to breath fast, and stuck his tongue out, like a dog. Juliane (his owner) took Boy home for the first time, Boy barks. Later then he learns to meow. Other than Boy, there's Kate. She has nerve problem. Her brain deteriorates day by day and now Juliane focus on Kate who needs full attention. Every time Kate gets panic attack, that's when the brain will slowly damage. So the more panic attack Kate gets, the more brain damage she'll suffer. Because of Kate's condition, moreover Kate can't see other cat else she'll start to get panic, Juliane decide to put Boy for adoption. Boy is at my place (Bubu's Shelter) now. Though he's big, he's domesticate. When he bonds with you, he'll start suckle your palm. That's how he shows affection. I've train him not to play with human hands, but sometimes he does. But he's a fast learner, so if you show that you're angry when he bites your hand or feet, he'll understand his mistake and stop doing it. So whenever he's hyper, make sure you have toys for him. He has also learn how to socialize. Adopter criteria: I need someone who's confident handling him. Better with experience and someone who's responsible and committed. view video of him suckling palm:",70c811b9d,0.3184763375440574,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,28,-10.954279423490485,0.9908847184986596,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0

I am very strict about not caging my fur kids and hope you don’t cage them (unless required by vet). Cats are curious animals and are constantly exploring their surroundings. Give them space to walk and run around. But also remember to kitty proof your house. Good Quality Food: My cats are fed some sort of premium brands. Good quality food is important to maintain their health and more beneficial for you in the long run (less vet visits!) Companions: Cats are very social animals and it is healthier to adopt two so they can have another cat to play or interact with. Especially if you are busy at work or otherwise most of the day :). But if you can only get one cat, then please consider adopting an adult cat. Adult cats are usually litter box trained, spayed and easier to take care. Their personality is developed and you know what you get. They are also more independent and mellow in their games and spend a lot of time napping ;). Medical/vets: My cats are not spayed/neutered if less than 6 months. You must agree to do so at 6 months. You must also agree to give booster shots (if required) and yearly veterinary examination. Other Conditions: I love to receive updates on their progress with pictures. Taking care of fur kids is easy. All they need is some food, lots of love & attention and they will be at your side all their life. But before adopting, please consider your financial situation. Good quality food, vet visits, etc will need to be budgeted.",9193c38af,-0.5416621989273103,4,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,-1.956121325623301,0.9193029490616622,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

She has a rough medium length coat (black and white). ♥ Kayla is under foster care as her family had to travel overseas due to unforeseen circumstances. Kayla is now seeking a permanent new family. _________________________________________________ Character: ♥ Kayla is an intelligent and high energy dog. She loves taking walks (especially running around fields, beaches, hiking, etc). If you're an active person, she will happily tag along on a leash as you do your daily runs/cycling/etc. :) ♥ DESPITE her energy; Kayla is a VERY calm dog when indoors! She will only get onto beds/sofas if invited and otherwise makes herself comfy where she can. ♥ Kayla understands a few commands like ""sit"", ""stay"" and ""shake"". She was also trained to wait for her food and walk off leash by her previous owners (however I have not followed up on this during the period of foster care). ♥ She has an amazing temperament too! Gets along well with dogs (cats also if she sees them indoors/as part of the family. Kayla is especially patient and loving around children, She's the type of dog that would lie in bed with the kids and keep them feeling safe/protected. ♥ Kayla requires NO grooming whatsoever as her fur stays the length it already is. She also hardly ""smells"" and only needs a bath once a month at most if indoors (unless she's really had a muddy run somewhere or rolled where she shouldn't). ♥ Kayla loves water too! She will half-sit in a pool, even chase after water sprinkling out of a hose. :) ♥ Potty habits; When indoors, Kayla will bark 3 - 4 times in a row to let her people know she needs to be let out to do her business. She appreciates routine daily walks (at least once in the morning, another in the evening before bedtime). ♥ Kayla is fully vaccinated (rabies shots included). She is also spayed, parasite free and micro-chipped. She is not fussy about food either. _________________________________________________ *** PLEASE READ (Note for potential adopters) *** ♥ Kayla takes time to adjust to new people (at least 2 weeks to trust). She will bond closely to anyone who pays the most attention to her. She will accept ""firm"" tones when being trained but NO rough tones/scolding of any kind. ♥ Kayla likes being indoors % EXCEPT when she needs to be taken out for some form of activity. Adopters practicing this are preferred. ♥ Kayla needs round the clock attention (she will get anxious if left crated any longer than 4 hours a day). Adopters with lots of time on their hands are her best preference. ♥ An adoption fee will apply to cover Kayla's basic care (please inquire). Her cards will be passed to successful adopters. :) _________________________________________________ Please drop me a call or email if interested in taking this girl home.

He used to be my friend's pet, but later given to me because my friend moved oversea. He already stayed with me for about 5 months until now. He really is a smart and beautiful cat, but since I'm just a university student I cannot afford the fee for his vaccination and neuter. He is now in heat state and need to be neutered soon or mate with female cat, but I don't dare to mate him with stray cat. So that is why I choose to give him for adoption for free, as a hope that someone might adopt him to take him to the vet or just mate him with female cat that you might have. Plus I will also give along his cage, food bowl, and litter box, all for free. Here I tell you some about Mio personality so you can take into consideration before adopt him. - Very talkative, so you have to be ready to hear some noises from him - He is on heat, so he will be more more noisy during night sometimes - Spoiled cat, so make sure you give him lot of affection - Toilet trained, he really can pee in your toilet bowl if you allow him to - Super clean, he doesn't like dirty cat litter - Stubborn, he can become very stubborn when it comes to bed, which he might insist to sleep with you on your bed or jump to your lap and he will become noisy if you don't let him to do so. - Afraid of thunder and heavy rain, yes if there is a thunder storm or heavy rain he will definitely meowing very loud to get your attention, he will be quiet when he is accompanied. - Might become aggressive to new cat, I guess this is because he is on heat, so if you wished to mate him with your cat it may take longer time for them to adapt. - Do not confine the cat in the cage although I give you the cage, because it will make him stress. But overall, he is very nice, cute and unique isn't he? He also love to cuddle :) Contact me by email or whatsapp if you are ready to adopt him and accept the consequences above. I really hope that you will become a nice new owner, and please BE A COMMITTED AND RESPONSIBLE OWNER for Mio.

With the help of Malaysia Dogs Deserve Better I was able to find homes for 6 of them through their amazing adoption drives. Lily Lulu was the 'runt' of the litter - the small weak one that nobody wanted. I decided to raise her, rather than throwing her to the streets, however I'm not Malaysian, and due to some unfortunate circumstances I'm transferring to a country that's even less dog friendly, and I can't take her with me (Although I wish I could). She's house trained (does her 'business' outside) around 95%, she's fully vaccinated, dewormed, had Tic prevention medicine applied and has recently been neutered. She has a good temperement - sometimes a little nervous of loud noises, but very playful. As all puppies do, she went through the chewing furniture stage, but has now passed that as her adult teeth have grown through nicely. She has the run of the house - and doesn't mind regular or air con rooms - she's happy in either. She likes to play fetch, and to chew on a nice 'treat' from the pet store. She can 'Sit', 'Stay' and if out walking 'Car coming' makes her sit down and wait for the car to pass. She gets these right about 90 percent of the time. She's fed on a mix of wet food and dry food - and certainly enjoys a few treats from time to time. I would hope that her future home would treat her in a similar way to the way I've brought her up so far, and not to be passed to a family who has the sole intention of chaining up a dog outside 24/7. I have to return to the UK very soon, and I really don't want to just throw her on the streets. If I can't find a home before I leave, then the only option I will have will be to destroy her. That's something I really don't want to do - so please - if you're looking for a well behaved, fairly housetrained fun dog, that also is happy to mix with other dogs, consider giving Lily Lulu a home. I don't want any money to cover any of the expenses I've incurred - but if anyone did want to make a donation to Malaysian Dogs Deserve Better - They would certainly welcome it. I would hope that whicever family took her, we could keep in touch, and if I could get back to Malaysia to see her again. She would come complete with bed, heartworm prevention medication for the next 5 months and a generous supply of dog food. If you'd consider giving Lily Lulu a home - please get in touch with me, and I'll happily bring her to meet you at your home anywhere in KL.",e911008b8,1.178614874015425,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,-0.3912242651246602,0.3381590705987489,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Tinka has attended dog trainings and knows the basic commands. She loves to learn new things and show her skills, and if she gets a praise for it - even better! although she makes an excellent guard dog she spends a great deal of the day being lazy and just being happy to be around someone. Her ideal family takes her out on walks and makes her part of the family (one of her happy days was when she ""convinced"" me that she was allowed to watch TV on the couch with me). In return she will be very loyal and watch out for her family. She doesn't like cats and needs some time to get used to other dogs. She was fine with our other two dogs, and I never had a problem taking her to the vet or leaving her at the kennel when we went away, but there are a few dogs in our neighborhood that she does not approve of. We currently allow her to be inside the house as well as in the garden, so please don't keep her in a small cage or on a chain all day long.

I believe that she was born by a mother of jack russell breed but I can't confirm. Many called in to ask if she is a PURE breed, but sad to say that she is what she is. Whether a pure breed or not, it is still going to be a very good companion dog anyway. She is going thru house training where it is trained to pee/poo on a same spot (old news paper) and not to bite anything that comes into her way (a dog's nature). She is very playful and human friendly. She will definitely loves you with everything she has got if you treat her with love. This one I can guarantee! She is suitable to be kept as a house pet rather than a guard dog (tied up just to guard the house). I believe every single animal on earth deserves to live with freedom, no body likes to be locked up. Those who respect life, loves dog and able to provide love instead of just food and shelter are welcome to adopt Milo. Thanks :) -------------------------------------------------- Rescued from somewhere near my house at Balakong. Found a total of 6 of them yesterday when I drove pass the area. 4 of them felt into a drain and were soaking wet. Me and my wife quickly take them out and found that they were abandoned by a irresponsible owner. They all inherited this jack russell's look leading me to think that they are all from a jack russell mother. Both of them with brown patches around their heads and fully white body. 4 of them were adopted by my neighbours and now left with 2. They are urgently in need of a home as we are only able to foster them until July as we will be away for few weeks for an oversea trip. Besides that, we have got 4 dogs already at home, could not afford to keep another 2 in. I hope some of you dog lovers out there can provide a home for these 2 lovely puppies. They are very healthy and ready to be rehomed. We bought them for first vaccination today and from the guess of the vet, they should be around 1-2 months old. Perfect for someone who is looking for a young puppy where you can start to build the relationship and bonding with them. They are both very active and playful.

Everywhere I went, people despised me. Then I found a place at a parking lot in a big condo where I could hide and rest. A lady who lives there noticed me while on her way to work. She was kind to me. As days passed, I began to trust her. One day I threw myself in front of her car and blocked it. I did not move till she came down and saw my condition. She called for her sons and one of her friends for help but i only trusted her, she put a leash on me and sent me to a nearby clinic. By then my leg was badly damaged , the vet had to amputate my front leg. After one week, i was discharged from the clinic but the lady dose not have any place to keep me so she asked somebody for help. My picture was posted up in facebook and lots of good-hearted people called and offered to foster me till I recover. Now I'm fully recovered and in need of a forever loving home.

GERBERA is a tropical plant of the daisy family, native to Asia and Africa, with large brightly colored flowers. Just like this little kitten that we are fostering - Gerbera, she is as beautiful as the flower. Gerbera was rescued months ago at a food court, she was only a 2 months old baby during that time. Poor little baby was hiding under a car and meowing loudly seeking for help as there were a group of excited dogs wanted to hunt her and they kept running and waiting around the car. With help of some kind people there, we managed to shooed those doggie away and brought her home. Gerbera loves a lot to have companion and friends, she do not like much to be cuddled but she will always stay beside you and ask for a pat and ""massage"", she lovesss a lot when people sayang her. Gerbera is always happy when we're back home, she will always purr when we're at her side. But Gerbera has a habit and we do not know why she has such habit..most of the time when we stand near the window she will quickly run towards the window and climb on the window grill, as if like she's making a performance and telling us that she's good on this (we tried to stop her at the beginning but still..she want to let us know that she's good at this..a spider-cat Gerbera! :P) Gerbera behaves very good on bathing time but she do not like to share her food and toy with her friends. She can eat together with friends if in different bowl but when they re eating same bowl of food, she will be very nervous and lift up her front paw to stop anyone from nearing the bowl but of course she do not bite or hurt anyone..

Has big ears and a droopy face - after checking him, vets suggested a mix of some Labrador genes. ♦ Very friendly boy and fast learner. Eager to do anything for treats! If you're looking for a lap-dog - he's the perfect candidate. Has no regard for his (still growing) size and lays down on human laps right to sleep. ♦ Perfectly fine in the company of people/crowds and other dogs. He loves his kibble and the occasional canned food (not at all fussy about what he's fed). ♦ Playful but not hyper. He does not bark unnecessarily (unless strangers approach gate). Borhan will go ""potty"" in the garden or grass patches only (% success). Never messes up his sleep/play area. ♦ Healthy boy, already de-wormed and vaccinated. Currently too young for neutering.

They were rescued by a jogger and other passersby and are now in the care of a few fosterers. Tabatha was seriously ill but has fully recovered. She's a survivor. She has a beautiful calico coat, long elegant tail, and big, green eyes. Tabatha is an inquisitive and intelligent kitten. Her curious nature makes her a mischievous tyke. She likes to follow people around and get involved with whatever they are doing. She loves playing with other cats and even cautiously hangs out with dogs. She is always running around, playing with toys and entertaining herself. She is quite vocal and very affectionate. Tabatha loves company and she would be terrific in a home with other cats or kittens and people who have time to spend with her. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Tabatha are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Tabatha is very sociable, playful, fun-loving, and energetic. Confining her in a small space would make her very unhappy.

Examples are his paws which are muscular and looks like a Rottweiler's paw. Onion is a good dog, he is like every other pet a family would need. Although there is the fact that he isn't really good with toddlers because he is considered medium in size and might accidentally push one over with his snout by sticking his nose in. He is nosy. He protects you from wild life harm like snakes, though remember after he does kill one, please throw it away asap as it could cause a bad stench or he might eat it, it never happened before but it could. Safety first. In conclusion, Onion is a great house pet, he needs space to venture and wonder as he is an agile dog, that requires exercise by running. He is "" okay "" for a family but not recommended for one that has toddlers unless fences are raised. He is also friendly to other people most of the time, but he still protects you from other wild beasts. We hope that Onion gets a good family so that he can protect and live a good life!

Doctor found about 4 maggot wounds on her, one near her left ear, 3 near the tail area. She had to be hospitalized for 4 days, did blood work as well as viral test, which she was negative for. She was anemic and her heart was weakened due to the prolonged infection. She even had to be force-fed with the IV on. Now she is so much more energetic with good appetite! Her suturing was done as well, medication is on for 7 days prior to her discharge on the 19th. Frigga is a very manja girl, who is quite obedient for a stray..she even waited for you to walk first when you walk her. She gets a little anxious when you leave her on her own, but as long as she can roam around the house she does not whine so much.

She was really frail and quite dirty with a skin condition, and was looking for a kind person to cuddle up to and not so much for food. But of course Malaysians being Malaysians, most of them shoo-ed her away and some even kicked her. The coffee shop owner then informed me that her mother had recently been killed - someone had poisoned her. As I usually have a small amount of dog food with me in the car, I gave her some. She ate a little but just wanted to be petted. She then went to another table curled up at the feet of this old man. Thankfully this man did not kick her. I asked several people if they would take her, but of course none would. In the end, I asked the shop owner for a box and brought her home. I just could not bring myself to leave her there. I took her to the vet and it was confirmed that she had a severe case of sarcoptic mange. She was treated with Ivermectin for 5 weeks and she is now a healthy, active puppy. We're not entirely sure what breed she is, but she looks like she could have some Jack Russell in her and possibly some Dalmation as well as she has quite a lot of spots... She has just received her first vaccination and will be completing the remaining 2 shots soon. She has a very good temperament and is good with other dogs. She is curious about our cat and has shown no signs of aggression towards it. She is very playful and is a fast learner.

Blackie Boy responds well to his name, and will look up everytime he's called, and knows the command come.

Note: he's a penchant to escape from homes where he doesn't feel loved, whereas at his fosterers..even when he strays out, he'd hang around just outside the home, knowing there's love and security there.

Please read their details below:- Fruitcake is a few minutes older than Marble & slightly smaller than Marble. Fruitcake loves hugs, pets, and fruitcake likes to talk.She responses with a meow, coupled with interested eyes. She cant understand you but she can understand your voice tone. She doesnt like it when my dog barks loudly in the house & she meows at my dog. A cat like gesture of ""please be quiet im trying to sleep"". Fruitcake LOVES fish and gets super excited each time I steam a couple of fishes for her and Marble. She loves running around the house specially during playtime & loves to be brushed. Overall she's a happy little kitty. Marble is younger than Fruitcake. She's the most playful kitty out of her siblings. Her big communicative playful eyes will surely keep you interested in her mischief. She learned how to play catch as a kitten & she loves it when you play hide & seek with her. She'll keep on playing till she pants like a dog & She'll always want to try on what you've in your mouth, especially ripe sweet mangoes, thats her fav fruit. She has issues with hugs (like most female cats do), but once she's brushed she'll ask for more and wont let you stop. Marble is also quite talkative, loves to eat and run around. If you're looking for a playful kitty, Marble would be fit to your preference. Note : FRUITCAKE & MARBLE'S BIRTH DATE IS ON THE 21ST NOV ! ** Fruitcake & Marble are siblings. Their mom adopted me to be her & her baby's caretaker. She just walked in the house, pregnant, and gave birth while I was her acting nurse. ** THEY ARE LITTER TRAINED. ** Fruitcake & Marble are inseparable. You can choose to adopt one of them, but it's best if you keep them together. They really adore & love each other. They are each others' motivator. ** They are kept in my apartment, never steps out my house and they have never been sick within the 2 years and 7 months (and counting) of their lives. ** Fruitcake & Marble both love fish, specially steamed fish coupled with a good fish broth. ** If you want to adopt them, please make sure to take good care of them. As their pet parent, I really care for their happiness & comfort & well being. ** You must be responsible & caring with these babies and you should tend to their needs, which they will definitely give you love, % in return. ** They aren't vaccinated & de-wormed. But if you are keen on adopting them, I will vaccinate & deworm them before handing them over to you. I ** Please option on neutering Fruitcake & Marble. This is to reduce the unnecessary babies, which would lead to abandoning. ** Once you agree to take them under your care, you, as the new owner should NEVER OPTION on abandoning them. YOU HAVE YOUR FAMILY, YOUR FRIENDS & YOUR THINGS BUT YOUR NEWLY ADOPTED CAT HAS ONLY YOU.

Everything a puppy should be. An elderly gentleman fell in love with Coops. We were worried that a puppy's exuberant energy might be too much for a senior citizen to handle but we were convinced otherwise by their devotion to each other. Unfortunately this happy ending was not meant to last forever. Coops elderly adopter can no longer cope with his strong teenage dog. We hope to find Cooper a new home with someone who will love him just as much! He is a very alert dog and knows basic commands in mandarin, cantonese, and english!! He knows how to sit, shake hands with his right paw and then his left paw. He's also housebroken and will only relieve himself during his morning and evening walks. Cooper needs a lot of exercise and space to run around in. He absolutely must NOT be tied up or caged. This would drive him crazy. He is very energetic. He also craves attention and human companionship. He'd love it if someone could play with him often. He is definitely man's best friend. Right now he weighs about 20 kilos and has been recently neutered. He is a healthy, inquisitive boy and doesn't display any aggressive behavior towards other dogs. He is eager to make friends. Cooper is an ideal companion and a great watchdog. He's very alert and will bark if a stranger approaches. Interested parties may call, sms, or email me for more information.
